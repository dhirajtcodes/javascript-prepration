// ðŸ§© Microservices
// Microservices is a backend architecture pattern where:

// The application is broken down into small, independent services.

// Each service handles one specific business capability (e.g., user service, payment service).

// Services communicate over APIs (usually HTTP or messaging queues).

// âœ… Key Features:
// Decentralized: Each service can use its own language, database, etc.

// Independent deployment: You can deploy one microservice without affecting others.

// Scalable: Scale individual parts of the system as needed.

// ðŸ“¦ Example:
// UserService: Handles user login, registration.

// ProductService: Manages product catalog.

// OrderService: Manages orders and payments.

// Micro Frontends applies the same concept of microservices to the frontend.

// Instead of a monolithic UI, the app is split into independent frontend modules.

// Each team can build and deploy their piece of the UI independently.

// Different micro frontends can be built using different frameworks (React, Vue, Angular).

// âœ… Key Features:
// Modular UI: Each module owns a part of the UI (e.g., navbar, product list, cart).

// Independent deployment: Update one UI module without redeploying the entire app.

// Team autonomy: Teams can work in parallel without UI merge conflicts.

// ðŸ“¦ Example:
// HeaderApp: Responsible for top navigation.

// ProductApp: Displays the product list.

// CartApp: Manages shopping cart.

// Imagine an e-commerce website:

// Backend is built using microservices:

// User service, Inventory service, Order service

// Frontend is built using micro frontends:

// Login module, Product listing module, Cart module
